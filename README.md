# PRODIGY_WD_01
This is the first task that is solved for my internship at Prodigy Infotech
Here, I have created a web page using HTML, CSS and Java Script. I have included the functionalities where the website contains 4 pages.
They are, Home, About, Services and Contact.
There is a navigating bar above on the web page and whenever we hover on a particular name like Home or About, the background color of the particular page changes.
This is the functionality of the wensite created.
